prions notorious protein-only infectious agents that cause invariably fatal brain diseases following silent incubation periods that can span lifetime. these diseases can arise spontaneously, through infection or be inherited. remarkably, prions composed self-propagating assemblies misfolded cellular protein that encode information, generate neurotoxicity evolve adapt vivo. although parallels have been drawn with alzheimer's disease other conditions involving deposition assemblies misfolded proteins brain, insights now being provided into usefulness limitations prion analogies their aetiological therapeutic relevance.
during last few years, understanding dysregulated hydrogen ion dynamics reversed proton gradient cancer cells has resulted new integral ph-centric paradigm oncology, translational model embracing from cancer etiopathogenesis treatment. abnormalities intracellular alkalinization along with extracellular acidification all types solid tumors leukemic cells have never been described any other disease now appear be specific hallmark malignancy. as consequence this intracellular acid-base homeostatic failure, attempt induce cellular acidification using proton transport inhibitors other intracellular acidifiers different origins becoming new therapeutic concept selective target cancer treatment, both as metabolic mediator apoptosis overcoming multiple drug resistance (mdr). importantly, there increasing data showing that different ion channels contribute mediate significant aspects cancer ph regulation etiopathogenesis. finally, we discuss extension this new ph-centric oncological paradigm into opposite metabolic homeostatic acid-base situation found human diseases (hndds), which opens novel concepts prevention treatment hndds through utilization cohort neural non-neural derived hormones human growth factors.
matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (maldi) time-of-flight (tof) imaging mass spectrometry (ims) enables localization analytes interest along with histology. more specifically, maldi-ims identifies distributions proteins, peptides, small molecules, lipids, drugs their metabolites tissues, with high spatial resolution. this unique capacity directly analyze tissue samples without need lengthy sample preparation reduces technical variability renders maldi-ims ideal identification potential diagnostic prognostic biomarkers disease gradation. maldi-ims has evolved rapidly over last decade has been successfully used both medical basic research by scientists worldwide. this review, we explore clinical applications maldi-ims, focusing on major cancer types diseases. particular, we re-emphasize diagnostic potential ims challenges that must be confronted when conducting maldi-ims clinical settings. this article part special issue entitled: maldi imaging, edited by dr. corinna henkel prof. peter hoffmann.
aggregation specific proteins plays pivotal role etiopathogenesis several diseases (nds). β-amyloid (aβ) peptide-containing plaques intraneuronal neurofibrillary tangles composed hyperphosphorylated protein tau two main neuropathological lesions alzheimer's disease. meanwhile, parkinson's disease defined by presence intraneuronal inclusions (lewy bodies), which α-synuclein (α-syn) has been identified as major protein component. current literature provides considerable insights into mechanisms underlying oligomeric-related neurodegeneration, as well as relationship between protein aggregation nd, thus facilitating development novel putative biomarkers and/or pharmacological targets. recently, α-syn, tau aβ have been shown interact each other or with other "pathological proteins" form toxic heteroaggregates. these latest findings overcoming concept that each disease related misfolding single specific protein. this review, potential opportunities pharmacological approaches targeting α-syn, tau aβ their oligomeric forms highlighted with examples from recent studies. protein aggregation as biomarker nds, both brain peripheral fluids, deeply explored. finally, relationship between biomarker establishment assessment their use as diagnostics or therapeutic targets discussed.
cellular autophagy major degradative pathway clearance aggregate-prone proteins damaged organelles. it plays an important role regulating cellular homeostasis, cell growth development, disease development. dysfunctional autophagy contributes pathology various diseases, such as alzheimer's disease, parkinson's disease huntington's disease, which specific pathological protein accumulation occurs. growing body evidence suggests that resveratrol plays significantly role regulation autophagy clearance pathological proteins. resveratrol potential drug diseases therapy. this review focuses on effects resveratrol on cellular autophagy clinical application control diseases.
mitochondria organelles responsible vital cell functions. p53 transcription factor that regulates dna stability cell growth normality. recent studies revealed that p53 can influence mitochondrial function changing from normal condition abnormal condition under different stress levels. normal state, p53 can maintain mitochondrial respiration through transactivation sco2. when stress stimuli presents, sco2 overexpresses leads ros generation. ros promotes p53 inducing malm (mieap-induced accumulation lysosome-like organelles within mitochondria) repair dysfunctional mitochondria miv (mieap-induced vacuole) accomplish damaged mitochondria degradation. if stress or damage irreversible, p53 will translocate mitochondria, leading into apoptosis or necrosis. diseases including parkinson's disease, huntington's disease alzheimer's disease still lack clear explanations mechanisms, but more studies have revealed functional relationship between mitochondria p53 towards pathological development these diseases. this review, we discuss that p53 plays vital role function mitochondria aspect pathological change metabolism. we also analyze these diseases with novel targeted treating molecules which related p53 mitochondria, hoping present novel therapies future clinic.
past decade has witnessed an explosion evidence suggesting that many diseases can be detected years, if not decades, earlier than previously thought. date, these scientific advances have not provoked any parallel translational or clinical improvements. there an urgency capitalize on this momentum so earlier detection disease can be more readily translated into improved health-related quality life families at risk for, or suffering with, diseases. this review, we discuss health-related quality life (hrqol) measurement diseases importance these "patient reported outcomes" all clinical research. next, we address hrqol following early identification or predictive genetic testing some diseases: huntington disease, alzheimer's disease, parkinson's disease, dementia with lewy bodies, frontotemporal dementia, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, prion diseases, hereditary ataxias, dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy wilson's disease. after brief report available direct-to-consumer genetic tests, we address juxtaposition earlier disease identification with assumed reluctance toward predictive genetic testing. forty-one studies examining health-related outcomes following predictive genetic testing disease suggested that (a) extreme or catastrophic outcomes rare; (b) consequences commonly include transiently increased anxiety and/or depression; (c) most participants report no regret; (d) many persons report extensive benefits receiving genetic information; (e) stigmatization discrimination genetic diseases poorly understood policy laws needed. caution appropriate earlier identification diseases but findings suggest further progress safe, feasible likely advance clinical care.
purpose this review discuss potential pathways involved pathogenesis diseases, highlighting current pharmacological drug targets neuronal apoptosis prevention. incidence these disorders expected rise coming years so finding effective treatments represents significant challenge medicine. alzheimer's disease parkinson's disease were both described almost century ago most important disorders developed world. however, molecular mechanisms that lead development neuronal pathology both diseases unclear. this reason, despite substantial research area, an effective treatment these diseases does not yet exist. present study we discuss depth pathways involved apoptosis neuronal death diseases. we also examine drugs that may have neuroprotective effect. inhibition apoptosis mediated by oxidative stress generation mitochondrial alteration or by blockade nmda receptors could constitute suitable therapeutic strategy alzheimer's disease. multiple therapy with antioxidants, cell cycle inhibitors, gsk3β inhibitors, statins could, future, represent suitable strategy delaying progression diseases. this research contributes development new methods field apoptosis inhibitors that could provide future tools treatment alzheimer's parkinson's disease, as well as other diseases.
diseases characterized by changes or apoptosis neurons involved networks, which important specific physiological functions. with development old-aging society, incidence diseases on increase. however, it difficult diagnose most diseases. at present, there too few effective therapies. advances stem cell biology have raised hope possibility therapy diseases. recently, stem cells have been widely attempted treat diseases animal model. here we review progress prospects various stem cells, including embryonic stem cells, mesenchymal stem cell neural stem cells so on, treatments diseases, such as parkinson's disease, alzheimer's disease, huntington' disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis/lou gehrig's disease.
